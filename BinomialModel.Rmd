Using Cox-Ross-Rubinstein method, where $\sigma$ is volatility and $\delta$ is a time step, we can find the risk-neutral probability. 

$$u = e^{\sigma \sqrt{\delta}}$$

$$d = e^{-\sigma \sqrt{\delta}} = \frac{1}{u}$$
$$p = \frac{e^{\sigma \delta t} - d}{u-d}$$
Knowing the risk-neutral probability, we can compute the the option value at $T_0$ by discounting the expected payoff
